\title{Multi-Person and Multi-Robot Behaviour Recognition Room using N-TOF Cameras}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
I want to develop a multi-RGB-D sensor setup that tracks multiple people, Identifies pose, identifies people, and performs behaviour recognition in a research environment. An environment with occlusions and obstacles that would otherwise make it difficult or impossible for a single RGB-D sensor to be used. Information from the system can then be sent to robots involved in interactions in real-time allowing for more complex behaviour responses.
